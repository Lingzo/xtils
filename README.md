# xtils: A C++ Utilities Library

[中文](README_zh.md)

## Overview

`xtils` is a comprehensive **C++17 utility library** designed to provide developers with a set of high-quality, reusable core components and helper modules.
The library aims to improve **development efficiency, maintainability**, and **runtime performance** in C++ projects, helping developers build **robust, efficient, and modern** applications with ease.

## Design Philosophy

`xtils` is built upon the following design principles:

- **Modern C++**: Fully leverages C++17 features and adheres to modern C++ programming paradigms.
- **High Reusability**: Modular utility components can be used independently or combined across different projects.
- **Lightweight & High Performance**: Minimizes runtime overhead without compromising code readability.
- **Consistent API Design**: Unified naming conventions and API styles for quick adoption and maintainability.

## Core Features

`xtils` aims to streamline C++ development by offering the following key features:

- **Application Services**: Provides a framework for defining and managing application services, promoting modularity and clear separation of concerns.
- **Configuration Management**: Offers mechanisms for defining, loading, and accessing application configurations, supporting various data types and hierarchical structures.
- **Debugging and Tracing**: Includes utilities for debugging, such as trace logging and performance tracing, to aid in development and issue resolution.
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Provides tools for implementing state-based logic, useful for managing complex workflows and system behaviors.
- **Logging System**: A flexible and customizable logging framework for outputting informational, warning, and error messages to various destinations.
- **Networking Utilities**: Contains components for handling network communications, facilitating the creation of connected applications.
- **System Interactions**: Offers abstractions for interacting with the underlying operating system, such as managing threads, processes, and environment variables.
- **Asynchronous Task Management**: Supports the execution and scheduling of tasks in the background, enabling responsive and non-blocking application designs.
- **General Utilities**: A collection of common helper functions and classes for everyday programming tasks.
